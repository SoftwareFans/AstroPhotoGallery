# Astronomy gallery

### April 20th 2017:

The project was part of the course "Software technologies" in Software University Bulgaria. It has been developed by 2 software development students with less than a year experience. The inspiration came from a website for astronomy pictures: <a href="http://www.emilivanov.com/index2.htm" target="_blank">http://www.emilivanov.com/index2.htm</a>. The rights to use the pictures for this project have been given by Emil Ivanov via email and the project will be presented to him too. This project will not be used for any commercial purposes - it is a non-profit student project.

Due to the small experience of the developers when the project was created, it does not pretend to be perfect from software engineering point of view. However, many hours have been dedicated to it in order to work, look and feel good.

The beautiful pictures are separated by categories. They can be searched by tags or by categories.

More details and features:

- Seed at first startup: Default administrator user account "admin@astrogallery.net", roles "Admin" and "User" and category "Other" are being created during the first start of the project

* A user can rate a picture only once; an uploader can't rate her/his own pictures
- Image validation: Image file extension and content validation - when a picture is being uploaded (valid for profile picture too) its content (the file header) is being checked in order to be determined if it is really an image. That way even if a user change the extension of a .txt file for example to .jpg the application will reject the file and won't store it anywhere.
